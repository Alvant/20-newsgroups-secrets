# Software

A couple of software-related files decoded from text, for example C programs.

The module is organized as follows.
Each folder on the same level as this README contains information about one found piece of software.
In each folder, there are two subfolders: *source* with .txt files in which the stuff was encoded and another one with decoded files.
