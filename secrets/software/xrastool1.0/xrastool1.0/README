xrastool is an animation package for Sun Rasterfiles written in XView.
Its main feature is a panel interface for convenient access to animation,
display, and colormap functions. On an unloaded Sparc IPX running twm
under X11R5, a display rate of 50 frames/sec can be attained with 100
400x400 8-bit images. The code has been compiled and extensively tested
on a Sparc IPX running SunOS 4.1.x, and has run satisfactorily under twm
and olwm. Whether the code runs on other architectures or configurations
is not yet known, so please let me know if you manage to port it success-
fully!

To compile this program, modify the flags at the beginning of the Makefile
as required. Be sure to specify where your XView libraries and header
files are located. Both cc and gcc will work for compiling. If the server
is likely to be slow, you may want to change the LIVE_SLIDERS #define in
xrastool.h to FALSE. Also, you may want to change the variable
NumReservedColors in cms.c. This specifies how many colors xrastool should
leave unchanged in the default colormap to minimize flashing when changing
the keyboard focus (doesn't _quite_ work right under twm...). After
successful compilation, simply move the executable (xrastool) and the
man page (xrastool.man) to the desired directory. Optionally, change
BIN_DEST and MAN_DEST in the Makefile as required and type "make install"
followed by "make install.man". The source (including the bitmaps
subdirectory) may then be deleted.

Bug reports, comments, etc. should be mailed to dcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk.

Enjoy!
