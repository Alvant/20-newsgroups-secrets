# Software

A couple of software-related files decoded from text, for example C programs.

The module is organized as follows.
Each folder on the same level as this README contains information about one found piece of software.
And in each folder, in turn, there are two subfolders: *source* with .txt files in which the stuff was encoded and another one with decoded files.
