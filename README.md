# 20-newsgroups-secrets

Twenty Newsgroups dataset — is a popular NLP dataset which consists of nearly 20.000 email text messages on 20 topics. 
Each message has a body, a header, a footer, and a timestamp.
The dataset can be used, for example, in experiments connected with text classification, clusterization, and in particular with topic modeling.

Documents of this text collection are mostly plain natural language text files, which contain nothing special.
However, it turns out that some of them may have really unique stuff inside.
For example, encoded .bmp images — email attachments which are actually a part of the text message.

In the repository there are just some interesting things found in the 20 Newsgroups dataset.
