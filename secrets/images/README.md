# Images

A couple of images found in the dataset files.
Each folder represents an image: inside there are source .txt file/files, and decoded image.
If the image is in .bmp format (which is usually the case), then there is also its conversion to .png or .jpg.


## Still a Secret

Encoded image is a luck, because it can be decoded.
Unfortunately, quite often the only thing that can be found in the dataset about a picture is its name and an external resource where it resided (at least at the time the email message was sent).

Nonetheless, it seems worth noting that the message *sci.space/61469* mentions two images of the moon:

> Subject: moon image in weather sat image
>
> an image of the moon has been caught in a weather satellite images of the earth.\
> it appears in both the 0430-1500UT ir and visual images of the earth.\
> the GIF images can be down loaded from vmd.cso.uiuc.edu and are named\
> CI043015.GIF and CV043015.GIF for the IR and visual images respectively.

Moreover, someone managed to distinguish some strange objects on these pictures, *sci.space/61503*:

> Subject: Re: moon image in weather sat image

Unluckily, these pictures could not be found: they are not encoded, and the server mentioned *vmd.cso.uiuc.edu* is unavailable.
